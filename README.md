# Movie Recommender System

Use data from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset to create a movie recommender system.

Included files:
- **load_movie_data.py**: Load csv files with movie data and perform preprocessing.
- **movies_EDA.py**: Functions to plot features of movie dataset.
- **Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb**: Collection of figures generated from exploratory data analysis.
- **Simple-Recommender.ipynb**: Recommender that returns titles of highest-rated movies in given genre or genres.

**Note**: This is my first time using git through the command line, so please bear with me if things don't look right quite yet.
